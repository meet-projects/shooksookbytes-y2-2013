<h2>Yemenite Falafel</h2>

<p>It’s unassuming little joints like these, which could be five or 50-years-old, that are at the heart of Israel’s restaurant culture. Many Jerusalemites claim that Merkaz Hafalafel Hateimani turns out the best falafel in Jerusalem. They may be right.As soon as you enter the narrow confines of Falafel Hateimani, you’ll come face-to-face with what's been called "respect in falafel form" – a free falafel ball straight from the fryer to munch on while you wait. It’s this kind of small gesture of appreciation for the customer, almost a miracle considering the general attitude of the Israeli service industry toward people who dare to utilize their services, that sets Falafel Hateimani apart. Also, of course, the falafel rocks.
A falafel in pita (priced a bit above average at 12 NIS), which is pretty much all they offer, comes with the standard array of salads, with a standout charif that manages to be both spicier and more flavorful than anyone else’s in the city. Come on Fridays and you'll be given falafel in lahuh, a spongy Yemenite pancake-like bread.</p>

<h2>Jaffar's Sweets </h2>

<p>A day spent in the Old City – whether solemnly following Jesus' last steps along the Via Dolorosa from the Lion's Gate to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or getting lost among the fragrant spices and abundant chintz of the Moslem Quarter market – will invariably leave you in needing to replenish your spent batteries. Nothing provides that much-needed boost like sugar, and there is absolutely nothing in the world more sugary than traditional Arab desserts.
Sugar-junkies are therefore advised to go visit Jaffar's Sweets, a Jerusalem institution on Souq Khan es-Zeit road by Damascus Gate. Jaffar's churns out abundant Arab sweets – usually combinations of shredded filo dough, chopped nuts and pistachio garnish, all drenched in honey.
A regional specialty is knafeh, composed of alternating layers of sweetened, melted goat cheese and shredded phyllo with a sweet, nearly-flourescent orange topping.</p>

<h2>Armenian Tavern  </h2>

<p>Jerusalem has been home to Armenians ever since the mass conversion of Armenia to Christianity in the beginning of the 4th century CE, and the community continues to reside in its own small quarter of the Old City, sequestered in a gated residential compound and apparently still haunted by the specter of the Turkish genocide of Armenians nearly 100 years ago. Posters detailing the progression of the genocide are plastered on walls throughout the quarter.
Most of the quarter may be closed to tourists, but the Armenian Tavern on Armenian Patriarchate Road provides an opportunity for the rest of Jerusalem's population to learn about the Armenian way of life; the Tavern is as much of as museum as it is a restaurant, a cavern brimming with traditional Armenian décor and crafts, including the famous Armenian hand-painted tile. The food itself is a hearty variation on Mediterranean fare, including lachmanjun (Armenian-style meat pizzas), basturma (dried spiced meat), and Armenian variations on shishlik, kebab and Jerusalem mixed grill.</p>
